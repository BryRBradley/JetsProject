# JetsProject "Welcome to the JetApp"

## Description
This java application read in a txt file of Jets. It then tracks the Jets information on an airfield by Type, Model, Speed, Range and Price. It utilizes interfaces to request a User to make selections from a menu to perform functions
within the application. Below is the list of functions you can perform on the JetApp.

### Menu Display
1. List Fleet
2. Fly all jets
3. View fastest jet
4. View jet with longest range
5. Load all cargo jets
6. Dogfight
7. Add a jet to Fleet
8. Remove a jet from Fleet
9. Quit

## Technology Used
 - Eclipse IDE  
 - Github
 - Sublime 
 - MacOS terminal 
 - Java . Microsoft Word 
 - UML
 - Zoom and Slack for troubleshooting and Senior developer input 

## Project Goals 
I wanted to meet all project requirements while sincerely trying to apply a "Macro to Micro" UML organization
method to guide when and where to start programming. 

In addition I wanted to stretch my ability to add functionality and refactor openly and freely without fear 
of breaking my code. 

Focus more on "write a little test a little" methodology.

## Lessons Learned
* With my expansion of testing more frequently I did not commit nearly as frequently as the previous project. 
I need to develop better workflow step habits. **Code-Test-Commi**

* When thinking through UML "Macro to Micro" plan for "test-lines".
I still struggled with coding in sysout or testlines while writing code sections. It was done aftewr I finished
a large section. 

* Researched github README syntax to increase my README functionality and improve on it every project. 

* Utilized all the TA Hours and it was a huge boost to my understanding and the application of what we have been learning. 
I am super grateful for the extra help and reviewing some topics that I didn't have a good grasp on. I would have been
stuck on this project without these hours. Instead I am surprised at how much I have already learned. I will absolutely be there next Saturday.


## Coding Time and Testing
+ 01 Mar 24  1500-2000 // V1 of JetsApp, methods, files initial builds were completed.
+ 02 Mar 24  1000-1530 // V2 pushed corrected a bunch of logic problems and wrote in test lines
to break apart my code for debugging. Tested and found a few bugs.
+ 02 Mar 24 1900-2000 // V3 bugs corrected, refactored and all Tests passed. Had a classmate review and stress test
he pointed out some small things "Add a catch here etc..."
+ 03 Mar 24 1700-1900 // V4 README.md finished and final refactoring, applications meets all requirments.
